# Basic MLflow Track

## Description
This repository contains the code and files for tracking machine learning experiments using MLflow. MLflow is an open-source platform to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.

## Project Structure
- `mlflow/`: Contains the main MLflow tracking scripts and configuration.
- `data/`: Stores the datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- `models/`: Stores the trained models.
- `scripts/`: Contains the scripts for training models, testing, and evaluating the results.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python and the required dependencies installed.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omgadekar2003/Basic-_MLflow_Track.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Basic-_MLflow_Track
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start MLflow server (for tracking):
   ```bash
   mlflow ui
   ```

2. Run your training script to log metrics and parameters to MLflow:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to view the MLflow UI and monitor your experiments.
